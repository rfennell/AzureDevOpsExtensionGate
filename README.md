# Azure DevOps Extension Gate

## Background
When releasing Azure DevOps extensions via an automated CI/CD process there is a problem, from the moment it is uploaded to when the extension's tasks are available to a build agent, is not instantiation. The process can potentially take a few minutes to roll out. The problem this delay causes is a perfect candidate for using  Azure DevOps [Release Gates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/gates?view=azure-devops) or [Environment Checks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/approvals?view=azure-devops); using the gate to make sure the expected version of a task is available to an agent before running the next stage of the CD pipeline e.g waiting after deploying a private build of an extension before trying to run functional tests.

To provide this check you can use an Azure Function. Historically I did created this via the Azure Portal, but in this repo I have moved the code to a project release via a YAML pipeline

## Using the Azure Function

In you Release add a gate or in your Environment add a check. 

- Set the URL parameter for the URL of the Azure Function. This value can be found from the Azure Portal. Note that you donâ€™t need the Function Code query parameter in the URL as this is provided with the next gate parameter. I chose to use a variable group variable for this parameter so it was easy to reuse between many CD pipelines
- Set the Function Key parameter for the Azure Function, again you get this from the Azure Portal. This time I used a secure variable group variable
- Set the Method parameter to POST
- Set the Header content type as JSON
```
    {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
```
- Set the Body to contain the details of the Azure DevOps instance and Task to check. This time I used a mixture of variable group variables, release specific variables (the GUID) and environment build/release variables. The key here is I got the version from the primary release artifact $(BUILD.BUILDNUMBER) so the correct version of the tasks is tested for automatically
```
    {
        "instance": "$(instance)",
        "pat": "$(pat)",
        "taskguid": "$(taskGuid)",
        "version": "$(BUILD.BUILDNUMBER)"
    }
```
- Finally set  the Advanced/Completion Event to ApiResponse with the success criteria of
```
    eq(root['Deployed'], 'true')
```
Once this was done I was able to use the Azure function as a VSTS gate as required
